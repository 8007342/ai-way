# TODO Tracking Index

Master index for all TODO tracking documents. Check here first to find pending work.

## Active Refactors

| Document | Status | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| [TODO-conductor-ux-split.md](TODO-conductor-ux-split.md) | **IN PROGRESS** | TUI/Conductor separation with Unix Socket IPC |
| [TODO-qa-testing.md](TODO-qa-testing.md) | **PENDING** | Unit tests, integration tests, pre-commit hooks |

## Enhancement Tracking

| Document | Status | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| [TODO-rich-ux.md](TODO-rich-ux.md) | SUPERSEDED | Original UX plan (now Rust-based, not Python Textual) |
| [agents/TODO.md](agents/TODO.md) | ONGOING | Agent profiles and future enhancements |
| [TODO-documentation.md](TODO-documentation.md) | ROLLING | Documentation updates needed for user docs |

## Principles

- Each major refactor/feature gets its own TODO-*.md file
- Mark items done in the relevant file, not this index
- Use feature creep items to capture scope expansion - don't block main refactor
- Commit stable checkpoints frequently to the refactor branch
