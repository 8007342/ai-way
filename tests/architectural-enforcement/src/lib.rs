//! Architectural Enforcement Integration Tests
//!
//! This package contains integration tests that enforce architectural principles:
//! - No sleep() calls in production code
//! - Proper async I/O patterns
//! - Cache validation
//! - Separation of concerns
//!
//! These tests are designed to catch violations early in the development cycle.
